# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repo includes the following:

1. [The original data](UCI HAR Dataset/), downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones [1]
2. [The analysis script](run_analysis.R), which turns the raw dataset above into tidy datasets.
3. [A code book](CodeBook.md), which describes the data, the variables in the final dataset, and each analysis step to go from (1) to (2).

## Running the analysis
To run the analysis, clone this repository, cd to it, then run the script run_analysis.R.
